# HISTORY.md: The Chronicles of Aksharamala ðŸš€

## **A Long Time Ago in a Land of Custom Fontsâ€¦**
Once upon a time (around 2000, which, in internet years, is the Jurassic period), **Aksharamala** was born from the noble quest of transliterating Indic scripts before Unicode had its act together. Back then, people used custom fonts like they were collecting rare PokÃ©mon cardsâ€”nobody agreed on a standard, and life was chaos.

## **The College Years: Where It All Started**
Before Aksharamala became a full-fledged transliteration tool, it had humbler beginningsâ€”**as a college project at JNTU College of Engineering, Hyderabad**. A curious mind (armed with caffeine and sheer determination) took on the challenge of **building one of the first transliteration engines for Indic scripts**. Little did anyone know, this student project would go on to survive long enough to see the AI age!

## **The Golden Era: Early 2000s**
Armed with C++ and Microsoftâ€™s MFC (yes, the relic of Windows past), Aksharamala took its first steps, solving the problem of mapping custom font gibberish into something meaningful. It worked! But, like all good things, it needed an upgradeâ€”because technology moves fast, and legacy code waits for no one.

## **The Great Slumber (Mid-2000s - 2024)**
Aksharamala, like a wise sage, entered deep meditation (also known as 'being on hold for two decades'). Meanwhile, the world adopted Unicode, and custom fonts started fading into obscurity like dial-up internet. But waitâ€”fast forward to **2024**, and suddenly, the need to preserve and modernize all those old Indic texts resurfaces! Enter: the **Great Revival.**

## **The Rebirth: 2024 and Beyond**
Now, armed with Go (because why not?), Aksharamala is back, reimagined as a modern open-source project. Unicode? âœ… Cloud-ready? âœ… API-friendly? âœ… Open-source? âœ…âœ…âœ…. The goal? To create a **fast, efficient, and intelligent transliteration tool** while keeping **backward compatibility** with those custom font files of yesteryear.

## **Whatâ€™s Next?**
- Transliteration that feels like magic ðŸª„.
- Supporting as many Indic scripts as humanly possible.
- A web UI that doesnâ€™t look like it time-traveled from 1999.
- Maybe even a mobile app (but letâ€™s not get ahead of ourselves). 

## **Disclaimer: A Word from Our Legal Team (Which We Donâ€™t Have)**
If you donâ€™t like the jokes, **blame ChatGPT** (not the maintainers). If you do like the jokes, we totally meant to do that. Either way, Aksharamala remains an awesome open-source project. ðŸš€
