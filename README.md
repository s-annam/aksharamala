# Aksharamala (aks.go)

Aksharamala is a versatile transliteration framework designed to convert text 
across multiple languages and scripts using customizable keymaps. This project 
builds upon the legacy of the original Aksharamala, introduced in 1989 as an 
undergraduate project and later expanded in 2000 with a C++ implementation.

This Go-based implementation modernizes the transliteration process with:
- JSON-based keymaps for flexibility and compatibility.
- Command-line tools for managing and applying transliteration schemes.

## History

- **1989**: Original Aksharamala developed as an undergraduate project. This
  was written in Turbo Pascal, to generate characters on a CRT and dot-matrix
  printers to type in Telugu. The solution was certainly matching that era.
- **2000-2003**: Built a brand new C++ version for Windows as a keyboard hook
  (or colloquially referred to as IME, Input Method Editor) and sold under the
  banner Deshweb.com Pvt. Ltd.
- **2025**: Reimagined as an open-source Go project with a focus on modularity
  and modern workflows. Largely reusing the concepts of transliteration while
  taking support from ChatGPT, Claude and Gemini to develop code using LLMs.
  The architecture otherwise has been evolved (for example, taking AKT text
  files into a JSON based format etc.) to fit today's needs.

### Contributors

## Usage

### aksharamala
Run the main transliteration tool with input text:

    ```bash
    ./aksharamala -keymap hindi -input "example text"
    ```

### akt_converter
Convert a .akt file to .aksj format:

    ```bash
    ./akt_converter input.akt output.aksj
    ```
